# Checkers
### What is this?
A two-player checkers/draughts game in Java. The program produces a desktop window with a checkers board.

### What was used in this project?
This project is comprised of primarily Java programming. Java Swing is used to produce the GUI and graphics.

### Project Status
Project is in the process of logic revisions and cleaner documentation. I hope to incorporate AI algorithms such as MinMax to have a Player be able to play a computer. Efficiency of an AI is a concern I believe is important to address.

### Game Rules
* Checkers/Draughts is a board game designed to be played by two players. The objective is to "eat" all the pieces of the other side. This game is played only on the darker tiles of the board. Normal pieces may only move diagonally forward one space at a time, if a same-side piece is present, they are not able to move.
* Pieces may only eat other-side pieces if there is another piece diagonal to them, and the tile behind that piece is open.
* If the opportunity to eat a piece is present, the player must eat the piece.
* Normal pieces that reach the other end of the board from their side are crowned king. Kings may move diagonally forwards and backwards.
* The first move is made by the black player side. Good luck and have fun!
